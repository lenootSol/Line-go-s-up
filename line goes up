#Preface 


0. In 2008 The Economy Collapsed


  mortage backed security
   seen as stable, profitable
  
   1. biggest returns come from when it first hits the market
   2. finite number of people and houses


   houses bought by speculators, price inflation, bad incentives, the bubble burst
   huge segments of the economy turn out to be dead trees
   bailed out by the govt, greed and fraud


  


1. Bitcoin 


   anticapitalism and hypercapitalism


   regulation


  difficult to understand to create illusion of legitimacy


 flexibility, anonymity, resistance to government policy


  slow and expensive, speculative financial vehicle, drug trade


  new medium, changing of the guard, !allegations of antisemitism


  problems are patterns of human behavior, not what they're doing it in 
  
   adversarial validation and diminishing returns
  
  new tool for existing wealth


  power requirements and consumption, on part with the consumption of a small country


  energy consumption critique 








2. Ethereum


   competing crypto, broader use cases
  
   distributed virtual machine


    immutable and eternal tokens


  The Infinite Machine Camille Russo


  Astroturfing schemes, stickers, optics


  pp101-102


  Conceptualized as valuable vs complexity of other systems (medical records)


  




 








3. The Machine 


   what Eth is build to do


    decentralized log of transactions


  consensus mechanism


  double-spend problem
    proof of stake


   "claims of scalability are backed by nothing but the creators word'


  rewarding the wealthy, exclusionary, centralizing small group of early adopters and wealthy


  forks


   rollback


  irreconsilable schisms


  !demolishing consumer protections  


  desirability of decentralization for supply chains 


  colluding parties entering bad info at the start, fraud


  MITM attacks


   solving problems blockchains introduce


  prohibitive transaction fees


  lack of real world use cases, goods and services to buy


  gas wars, capitalizing on stakes


  volatility 


  stablecoins 
   taxes
   liquidity in the ecosystem 
    tether and bitfinex, theoretical speculative price, cashing out, 


  pyramid/ ponzi/ fool scam
  
  greatest rewards to earliest adopters


  zero sum game, or negative sum, infinite chain of greater fools




  




4. NFTs Exist To Get You To Buy Crypto


  true digital objects


  strict uniqueness


  simulacrum 


  strictly unique tokens, packet of data 


  smart contracts


  unity of programming and law


  disconnect between claimed and actual functionality


  financialization of everything


  NFTs exist to lend credibility to the cryptocurrencies they exists on top of 


  static URLs, functional programs


 Beeple 69mil usd sale


  selling high profile memes


  free artists from gig economy


  passive revenue from sales


  what is actually being bought and sold?


  link rot


  claims of digital scarcity apply only to the token itself, not the thing its pointing to


   relationship between image and tokens


  root proof of authenticity


  bad data going in at the front


   profiting off someone elses art


  !being sold vs transferred- marketplaces that don't use royalties


  closed market using casino chips


  Attack of the 50 foot blockchain, David Gerard


  Marketplace vs casino, gamble

5. The Unbearable Cringe Of Crypto 


  anxiety of about future, tenuous status


  rug pull, fraud and deception


  market manipulation, inflating price

  internal propaganda, speculative bubble, credibility 
 
 not an underyling "thing"


  ongoing projects that you buy into


  VC style investment


  to the moon or unofficial hedge fund


  "This is a cash flow"


  the "concept" of a video game


  10,000 cap, mint cost onto buyer


  payday for failure


  story to sell instead


  indeterminite future


  whatever it is , it will make your value appreciate


  buzzwprd














6. A Self-Organizing High Control Group


 toxic positivity


  primary product is hype


  runaway sales


  enthusiasts/ evangelists have meaningful financial stakes in something that doesn't have form, holding hot potato


  toxic positivity


  ostracize doubters, FUD


  no answers, incentive to enforce illusion


  ritual that affirms ingroup membership, gm etc


  no true scotsman, 


  ignoring warning signs
  
  narratives and deception


  beliefs based on no observable evidence




7. Crypto Reality


  what do the tokens do? 


  Wolf game critique


  Metamask


  Point of failure and attack


  Scams in unregulated market


  Pump and dumps


  MITM attacks are rare


  Bug bounty


  !Offer/confirmation step


  System security- parsing legitimate and illegitimate transactions

  low privacy, low trust envirnment


   Proof of identity, Sybil attack


   Pseudonymous


   Nothing can be deleted without tremendous effort


   Using blockchain as storage medium for entire social network


   Dumping malware tokens into wallets


   Eth as a central platform


   No mechanism to act in the interest of marginalized people


   Only the wealthy have access to justice


   Pooling data in one place, privacy failure












9. If This "Looks Like Scam" Then Every NFT Room I'm In Looks Like Scam LOL


  access passes


  treat everything as a financial asset


  paywalls


  blindspots, enforcement of ownership, corporations throwing weight in space


  lock products down even tighter


  Squid Game rug pull


  Untradable in practice


  Rules must be evaluated by their ability to oppress


  Nestle track unionization efforts in real time


  !! ahistoric, tokens all the way down, worse version of the current system





10. Play To Earn Exists To Get You To Buy Crypto 

  SLP game, whale scholars


  playing to make money, cashing out


  unsustainable economic model, runaway inflation and deflation


  play to earn incentive set, industrialize platform, changes the way they play the game


  "retain value" speculative price


  "grind harder or you're fired"







11. We're All Gonna Make It And By "We" I Mean "Us" Not You

   dedication of people into NFTs, subculture


   bubbles


   things not contained in the chains themselves, ephemeral


   referencing the exact same media


   hard forks


   monolithic victor


   new token and notes


   impenetrable and brittle


   slow, difficult, opaque

   Consensys, Opensea, filling power roles 


   Interpreter of chain


   BAYC fraud


   Not what the chain says, what the chain means











12. DAOs Exist To Get You To Buy Crypto 


  people, digital machine of smart contracts, token to interact with


  substantial amount don't have all 3


  laying the seeds for the future status quo


  managing on-chain assets


  *The Dao


  Smoke and mirrors, just voting shares


  How many problems even can be solved by code? Red just doesn't get along with blue, etc


  What if someone with an important token dies?


  ! Constitution DAO recent failure


  Just a productivity tool


  Minimize liability on the part of creators


  Copyright issues, amorphous cloud, responsibility


  Nothing truly revolutionary about structure


  Mildly decentralized cartel


  Governance tokens 


  High powered voting blocks


  Rewarding highest stakeholders, not democratic or equitable, no flat hierarchy


  Li Jin and democracy


  Just shareholding and "the corporatization of everything"








13. I Know It's Rigged, But It's The Only Game In Town


  Turf war between wealthy and ultra wealthy


  Economic disparity


  Useless but expensive is half the point


  People who feel their opportunity is shrinking


  Bet on the right discord and "make it"


  Stick it to wall street and pay no attention to VCs behind the curtain


  Buy in now and be the high tech future boot


  all interaction into transaction


  different systems are not inherently better


  same exploitation
